## Project task

This web app is about songs. I used Musixmatch API. CORS policy was causing me problems, but i managed to fix it with heroku.

## Project overview

You can search and learn more about songs, but most importantly you can read lyrics of a certain song. It displays top 10 most popular songs and basic info like artist and song genre. I used fetch and promises to get API data. I also created loader.

## Built with

- Sass
- React Router Dom
