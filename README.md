## Project task

This web app is about songs. I used Musixmatch API. CORS policy was causing me problems, but I managed to fix it with Heroku.

## Project overview

You can search and learn more about songs, but most importantly you can read the lyrics of a certain song. It displays the top 10 most popular songs and basic info like artist and song genre. I used fetch and promises to get API data. I also created a loader.

## Built with

- React
- Sass
- React Router Dom
- Musixmatch API
- JSON
- GitHub Pages
