# Lyrics search

This project is about music. It is made in React. I used Musixmatch API to create this project, where you can search and learn more about songs, but most importantly you can read lyrics of a certain song. I used fetch and promises to get API data. I also created loader. CORS policy was causing me problems, but i managed to fix it with heroku.

## Used Technologies
